Watch the robot in action as it performs walking gaits and autonomously navigates its environment!

## 🔬 Project Overview
This quadruped robot uses:

1 Arduino Nano as the central processing unit.

12 Servomotors (3 per leg) to create structure for fluid movement.

An Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) for detecting obstacles and autonomous navigation.
